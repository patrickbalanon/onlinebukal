				<h3> SandiganTV once again showcased their talents as they win their straight second championship in Television Broadcasting Filipino, after the fourth place finish last Regional Schools Press Conference 2017. </h3>
				<p> Patrick Balanon, the team leader of SandiganTV expressed his nervousness upon the start of the competition last October 23. </p>
				<p> "Syempre, final year ko na 'to and ayoko naman na sa huling taon ko pa ako matatalo," said Balanon. </p>
				<p> As soon as the team reached the contest area, they started shooting different cuts for the production. Luckily, their hardwork paved a way to RSPC as they win first again in the competition.</p>
				<p> But before the major awards were given, special awards were awarded first. Balanon won the Best News Presenter award, and the team got the Best Script and Most Promising Video Journalist. </p>
				<p> "Nakaka-proud na sa last year ko pa talaga na-receive 'yung mga special awards na 'yon. Parang bonus na lang siya eh, kasi what's the use of those special awards if we can't move to RSPC naman 'di ba," Balanon added.</p>
				<p> Happiness were all plastered to the faces of SandiganTV as they vowed to come back stronger in RSPC and try to claim the lone spot for the NSPC. It may be hard to reach and claim the win, but through hardwork and persiverance, everything would be possible. </p>
